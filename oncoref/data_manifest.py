"""The complete, classified inventory of oncoref-domain data.

This is the single declarative source of truth for *what data oncoref owns*
and how each dataset is held. ``catalog.inventory()`` exposes that current
self-owned inventory. A separately named, version-pinned pirlygenes migration
snapshot preserves the June 2026 takeover audit without pretending to follow
later additions or removals in another repository.

Ownership rule:
  oncoref owns empirical base facts and reference mechanics: canonical gene IDs,
  cancer ontology, reference expression/normalization, epidemiology, TMB, ICI/aPD1,
  source-anchored CTA facts, and measurement/provenance tables. pirlygenes owns
  purpose-specific gene sets/panels and target-to-therapy registries. trufflepig
  owns per-sample rules and QC interpretation.

Held buckets (oncoref domain):
  WHEEL     — small base-layer tables shipped in the wheel (no fetch). A
              ``legacy-compat`` category marks shipped historical surfaces that
              remain importable but are frozen. ``legacy-dataset-dispositions``
              records the replacement owner/surface for every such table.
  BUNDLE    — heavy expression artifacts in the version-pinned release tarball.
  HPA       — Human Protein Atlas reference tables fetched per-source on demand.
  SOURCE    — the raw per-sample TPM matrices (a separate large optional bundle).
  PLANNED   — oncoref-domain fact tables still to port.
  SUPERSEDED— a pirlygenes table oncoref replaced with its own regenerated one.

OUT_OF_SCOPE — pirlygenes or trufflepig data that is NOT oncoref's domain:
  target-selection panels, marker/signature gene sets, therapy modality catalogs,
  sample-rule tables, and artifact/QC interpretation rules.

The catalog (:mod:`oncoref.catalog`) manages the fetchable subset; this module
is the inventory + classification.
