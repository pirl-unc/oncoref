"""Immune-checkpoint-inhibitor (ICI) response (ORR) by cancer type and regimen.

Generalizes the anti-PD-1 layer (:mod:`oncoref.apd1`) to **all three checkpoint
regimens, each kept as a distinct source of response data**:

- ``"PD-1"``        — anti-PD-1 monotherapy (pembrolizumab / nivolumab / cemiplimab)
- ``"PD-L1"``       — anti-PD-L1 monotherapy (atezolizumab / durvalumab / avelumab)
- ``"PD-1+CTLA-4"`` — anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4 combination (nivolumab + ipilimumab)

Unlike the representative one-row-per-cancer ``cancer-apd1-response.csv``, the ICI
table (``cancer-ici-response.csv``) is a **long table**: a cancer type can carry a
value for more than one regimen (e.g. melanoma under both anti-PD-1 mono and the
ipi+nivo doublet), so regimens can be compared within a cancer. Every value is a
representative ORR anchor from a pivotal trial, with a citation — not an exact
reproducible constant (it shifts with data cutoff, line of therapy, and PD-L1 / MSI
selection; the ``setting`` and ``notes`` columns record that context).

:func:`cancer_ici_response` exposes the **fallback resolution** the analysis layer
usually wants — prefer anti-PD-1 monotherapy, fall back to anti-PD-L1 where that is
missing, then to the combination — via the default :data:`REGIMEN_FALLBACK` order;
pass ``regimen=`` to pin a single regimen instead, or ``fallback=False`` to get the
full per-regimen mapping.

Curation & pooling criteria
---------------------------
The wider evidence base (``cancer-ici-response-estimates.csv``, exposed by
:func:`cancer_ici_response_estimates_df` and pooled by :func:`pooled_ici_response`)
follows three rules that matter when curating new trials or interpreting a pooled value:

1. **Reported, computed, and derived values stay distinct.** ``value_basis`` records
   whether a value was reported directly, computed from reported counts, inferred
   from outcomes, combined across cohorts, retained as overlapping context, or
   curator-modeled. :func:`pooled_ici_response` accepts direct reported values and
   same-cohort count calculations; it excludes inferred, cross-cohort, contextual,
   and modeled values.

   Legacy prevalence models for all-comer ``COAD``, ``READ`` and ``UCEC`` remain
   ``derived_blend`` audit context. They are excluded from both representative
   anchors and pooling. Selected exceptional-responder cases likewise cannot
   establish a population ORR: ``UCEC_POLE`` is an explicit evidence gap.

2. **Never double-count patients.** A single trial routinely reports an all-comer cohort
   AND its own biomarker subgroup (e.g. ``BLCA`` KEYNOTE-052 all-comers + the CPS≥10 subset;
   ``LUAD`` all-comers + PD-L1≥50%). Those share patients, so summing their denominators
   inflates ``n``. Each estimate row therefore carries a ``role``: ``"primary"`` (the one
   representative cited setting) or ``"alternate"`` (other trials/subgroups). Pool only
   rows describing the **same population and line of therapy**, and never an all-comer
   cohort together with a subgroup drawn from it. The default uses only primary
   rows within one regimen. Explicit ``include_alternates=True`` requests retain
   the full source list but block pooling when shared trial identities indicate
   possible overlap. This guard is conservative, not a proof of independence.

3. **Comparability.** ORR shifts with line of therapy, PD-L1/MSI selection, and data
   cutoff; medians (PFS/OS/DOR) cannot be pooled at all without patient-level data. Treat
   ``value_range`` as a heterogeneity check before trusting a single pooled number.

    ``value_range`` are returned.

    Setting heterogeneity is real (all-comer vs PD-L1/MSI-selected vs different lines).
    By default the pool includes only the cited primary setting. Pass
    ``include_alternates=True`` to inspect additional studies; possible overlap
    blocks numerical pooling with an explicit ``pooling_block_reason``. Inspect
    each source's ``setting`` in ``sources`` to judge comparability. The
    per-source breakdown and ``value_range`` are always returned so heterogeneity (and
    any overlapping subgroups) stays visible. ``verified_only`` (default) keeps only
    audit-confirmed citations.

    Direct evidence for the requested endpoint and optional regimen takes precedence
    over evidence-source fallback (for example, ADCC combination evidence before
    pan-salivary SGC evidence). Non-poolable value bases are excluded before choosing
    the source code; contextual rows cannot mask that fallback. ``verified_only`` and
    ``include_alternates`` then filter the chosen source without switching populations.
    Parent-tree inheritance is not applied.

    With no explicit ``regimen``, select one using ``REGIMEN_FALLBACK`` within
    the resolved source population. ``selected_regimen`` records that choice.
    Control arms and mixed-agent contextual cohorts never enter the pool.
