__version__ = "1.8.66"

# Version of the downloadable data bundle (the heavy per-cohort percentile +
# representative shards). Bump when the DERIVED reference artifacts change — it pins
# the bundle filename, GitHub-release tag, and on-disk cache. Decoupled from
# __version__ so a code-only release reuses the last uploaded bundle. 5.23.0 made the
# shards dense in the canonical gene-ID space (oncoref#135 item 6). 5.23.3 is the
# first oncoref-owned QC-policy bundle: derived expression artifacts are rebuilt from
# source matrices with sample_qc="pass" by default and ship build/QC metadata.
DATA_VERSION = "5.23.3"

# Version of the per-cohort RAW source matrices (source_matrices.py). Independent of
# DATA_VERSION: the source matrices are the unchanging raw-TPM inputs, while DATA_VERSION
# tracks the derived bundle that's rebuilt from them. Canonicalization happens downstream
# (read/build time), so a canonical-space bundle bump must NOT repoint — or orphan the
# local caches of — these raw matrices. Bump only when a cohort's raw matrix changes.
