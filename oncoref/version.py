__version__ = "1.8.206"

# Version of the downloadable data bundle (the heavy per-cohort percentile +
# representative shards). Bump when the DERIVED reference artifacts change — it pins
# the bundle filename, GitHub-release tag, and on-disk cache. Decoupled from
# __version__ so a code-only release reuses the last uploaded bundle. 5.23.0 made the
# shards dense in the canonical gene-ID space (oncoref#135 item 6). 5.23.3 is the
# first oncoref-owned QC-policy bundle: derived expression artifacts are rebuilt from
# source matrices with sample_qc="pass" by default and ship build/QC metadata.
# 5.23.4 adds TCGA-STAD and TCGA-UCEC molecular-subtype representative,
# percentile, within-sample, source-QC, and reference-expression shards.
# 5.23.5 adds physical source grouping, actual source-sample QC, representative
# roles, and benchmark-eligibility provenance to representative artifacts.
# 5.23.6 canonicalizes the physical DDLPS/WDLPS TCGA-SARC source identities.
# 5.23.7 renames the generic Treehouse-reprocessed TCGA sample cohort and shards.
# 5.23.8 adds MBL molecular-subgroup source matrices and derived artifacts.
# 5.23.9 splits the mixed GSE294016 salivary panel into diagnosis-backed ADCC
# and ACINIC artifacts and removes nonmatching histologies from both cohorts.
# 5.23.10 rebuilds BL and SARC_PEC summaries from the same QC-pass samples used
# by their percentile, representative, and within-sample artifacts.
# 5.23.11 classifies the GDC-derived SARC_PLEOLPS Treehouse overlay with the
# other TCGA-SARC histology cohorts instead of the generic TCGA sample cohort.
# 5.23.12 marks the duplicated metaplastic BRCA/BRCA_Basal source vector as a
# reviewed dual-lineage audit representative rather than ordinary benchmark truth.
# 5.23.13 assigns every representative source group to a deterministic,
# leakage-resistant train, validation, external-validation, or audit-only role.
# 5.23.14 adds the three-tumor SARC_MMNST source and derived artifacts from
# checksum-pinned NCBI SRA Gene Feature count analyses for PRJNA1083972.
# 5.23.15 adds the pinned TCGA tumor-attributed and source-separated subtype
# tumor-reference summaries, including source-level derivation provenance and
# repaired BeatAML passthrough summaries from QC-pass samples in the existing
# source matrices. 5.23.16 corrects those BeatAML summaries by applying the
# declared canonical 16/9/75 clean-TPM transform to the raw source matrices.
# 5.23.17 adds public IFS/CMN physical sources and rebuilds all cohorts after
# classifying protocol-sensitive structural ncRNAs in clean TPM's technical
# compartment; concentration QC now evaluates the clean rather than raw space.
# 5.23.18 adds the five-donor direct HCL reference. 5.23.19 adds direct BCC,
# cSCC, and GBC references and makes the complete CHOL/GBC BTC union available.
# 5.23.20 adds the 11-patient diagnosis-stage EPN malignant-cell pseudobulk.
# 5.23.21 adds the 29-donor direct OpenPBTA craniopharyngioma reference.
# 5.23.22 adds the 32-donor H3 K27-altered DIPG reference and corrects redundant
# OpenPBTA PAR_Y symbol aliases in the CRANIO and DIPG source matrices.
# 5.23.23 adds the nine-donor direct VSCC reference from checksum-pinned NCBI
# Gene Feature counts and the complete thirteen-tumor clinical/HPV audit.
# 5.23.24 adds the 384-tumor direct meningioma reference from the
# checksum-pinned GSE270638 HTSeq raw-count matrix.
# 5.23.25 adds a receptor-defined primary BRCA_TNBC cohort, distinct from PAM50.
DATA_VERSION = "5.23.25"

# Version of the per-cohort RAW source matrices (source_matrices.py). Independent of
# DATA_VERSION: the source matrices are the unchanging raw-TPM inputs, while DATA_VERSION
# tracks the derived bundle that's rebuilt from them. Canonicalization happens downstream
# (read/build time), so a canonical-space bundle bump must NOT repoint — or orphan the
# local caches of — these raw matrices. Bump only when a cohort's raw matrix changes.
