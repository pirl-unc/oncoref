"""Tissue definitions and HPA confidence thresholds for CTA restriction analysis.

Ported (HPA-only) from ``tsarina.tissues`` so cancerdata can regenerate the
bundled ``cancer-testis-antigens.csv`` restriction/filter columns from HPA data
alone. The MS-related constants and the CTA-universe membership rules (the
gene-family exclusion and the never-expressed rescue) are intentionally NOT
here — they live in :mod:`cancerdata.cta`.

Three tiers of reproductive tissue sets determine how strictly a gene's
expression must be confined to qualify as a cancer-testis antigen:

- **Core**: testis, ovary, placenta -- the classic CT restriction definition.
- **Extended**: core + other reproductive-tract tissues (cervix, endometrium,
  epididymis, fallopian tube, prostate, seminal vesicle, vagina).
- **Permissive**: extended + breast (including lactating breast).

Thymus is excluded from all restriction checks because AIRE-mediated expression
in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is expected for CTAs and does not
indicate somatic tissue leakage.
